            <b>About Moshe</b>
            <p>
                Moshe was born on April 4th, 1930 in Tel-Aviv.
                <br />
                He lived there until the age of 4, when the family moved to Haifa.
                <br />
                Among his Tel-Aviv neighbors were David Remez (who
                <br />
                would later be the Minister of Transport) and David Ben-Gurion.
                <br />
                His father Iser (brother of Berl Katznelson),
                <br />
                was a bus driver and later on a storekeeper,
                <br />
                and his mother Sonya was a homemaker.
                <br />
                Moshe studied in the "Hebrew Reali School" from 1st grade to 8th grade
                <br />
                and then studied two more years in the maritime school near the Technion.
                <br />
                In 1946, when he was only 16 years old,
                <br />
                Moshe joined the Palmach while hiding his real age.
                <br />
                After a period of service, Moshe returned to Haifa and started working on a ship.
                <br />
                During his work Moshe traveled all over Egypt and also visited Yemen,
                <br />
                Iran and Pakistan.
                <br />
                On November 29th, 1947, the "partition plan" was approved in the UN.
                <br />
                Israel's independance war began and Moshe joined the Palyam in Caesarea.
                <br />
                He fought in the "Kastel battle" in Jerusalem and killed the leader of the arab forces.
                <br />
                He would later on join the Navy and serve there until February, 1950.
                <br />
                After his military service, Moshe and other former Navy members started a shipping
                <br />
                company together with "ZIM".
                <br />
                Life on the ship were full of thrills,
                <br />
                and Moshe got to travel through Europe and North America.
                <br />
                After a few years, Moshe decided to move to a new field
                <br />
                and started working as a zoology teaching assistant,
                <br />
                a class that he would later on teach himself.
                <br />
                While serving in the reserves forces in 1954,
                <br />
                his unit was stationed in Zemah near the Kineret,
                <br />
                where he met Shosh who he would marry two years later.
                <br />
                Moshe taught zoology for many years and worked in various zoology departments,
                <br />
                including those of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and Michigan University.
                <br />
                After his return from Michigan, Moshe worked for "Mekorot" company,
                <br />
                and the family moved to Kiryat Tiv'on.
                <br />
                Moshe and Shosh had 6 kids, 18 grandkids, 14 great-grandkids and counting..
                <br />
                Moshe passed away on November 5th, 2021 at the age of 91.
