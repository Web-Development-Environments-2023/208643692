This repository contains the HTML and CSS code for my website-a website about my grandfather who passed away.
I took the liberty of modifying some features and adding some in order to keep the website respectful.
For the Q&A part, I chose to answer the questions in this file instead of the website, again out of respecfulness.

The differences between Web 1,2,3 and their use-cases:

1. Functionality-Web 1 is read-only, web 2 is read-write, web 3 is portable and personal. For example, if the use-case is searching for a recipe, in web 1 we'll find pages with recipes, in web 2 we'll find blogs with recipes and comments and in web 3 there will be multiple results according to our past preferences.
2. Purpose/Focus-Web 1 is company focused, that means companies publish themselves and people watch their product. Web 2 is community based (blogs, social networks and so on...). Web 3 is individual based, the single user is in the center. In the use case of researching a hobby, web 1 wouldn't be too relevant. Web 2 would give us social groups related to the hobby and web 3 would provide us information and recommendations for the said hobby.
3. Operation of Search Engines-In web 1 search engines retrieve macro contents. In web 2 search engines retrieve tags with micro content, but the tagging is manual. In web 3 the tagging process is automatic. If we search for information about a niche topic, web 1 would probably be inaccurate, web 2 would give partially relevant results and web 3 would be the most accurate and personalized.
